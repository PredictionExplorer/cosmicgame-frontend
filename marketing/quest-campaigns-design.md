## Technical Implementation

### On-Chain Verification Requirements

For Galxe and Layer3 to verify on-chain tasks, provide:

1. **Contract addresses** (Arbitrum One)
   - CosmicSignatureGame proxy address
   - CosmicSignatureToken address
   - CosmicSignatureNft address
   - StakingWalletCosmicSignatureNft address
   - StakingWalletRandomWalkNft address

2. **Event signatures** for verification
   - `BidPlaced(address indexed bidder, uint256 roundNum, int256 randomWalkNftId, int256 cstBidPrice, uint256 ethBidPrice, string message)` -- ETH and CST bids
   - `MainPrizeClaimed(uint256 roundNum, address indexed claimer)` -- round end
   - `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId)` on CSN/RWLK -- NFT mint/transfer events
   - `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)` on CST -- token mint/burn
   - `NftStaked(address indexed staker, uint256 indexed nftId)` -- staking events
   - `NftUnstaked(address indexed staker, uint256 indexed nftId)` -- unstaking events
   - `DelegateChanged(address indexed delegator, address indexed fromDelegate, address indexed toDelegate)` -- CST delegation

3. **Subgraph or API endpoint** (if available) for complex queries like:
   - "Has this address bid 3+ times?"
   - "Does this address have staked NFTs?"
