        Cosmic Signature is a strategy bidding game. In an exhilarating contest,
        players will bid against other players and against time to win exciting
        $ETH prizes and Cosmic Signature NFTs.
      </Typography>
      <Typography mb={4}>
        Here are the exact steps to play the Cosmic Signature game.
      </Typography>
      <Box mt={8}>
        <Typography variant="h5" mb={4}>
          Step 1: Connect Your Wallet.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          When you land on the Cosmic Signature website (
          <Link href="www.cosmicsignature.com" target="_blank">
            www.cosmicsignature.com
          </Link>
          ), you will be automatically prompted to connect your crypto wallet to
          the website.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={4}>
          If you are not prompted, click the [Connect Wallet] button at the top
          of your homepage screen.
        </Typography>
        <Box mb={4}>
          <img src="/images/screenshot1.png" width="100%" />
        </Box>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Since the game is deployed on the Arbitrum blockchain, you will have
          to connect with a wallet that supports the Arbitrum blockchain, like
          Metamask Wallet.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Once you have connected your wallet, you will be asked to swap your
          network to Arbitrum. Switch your network, review the contract, and
          then approve permissions.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={4}>
          Once approved, you will see your wallet address displayed at the top
          of the Cosmic Signature website.
        </Typography>
      </Box>
      <Box mt={8}>
        <Typography variant="h5" mb={4}>
          Step#2: Check The Bid Price!
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Before you place a bid, you want to start by checking the round
          details.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Review these 4 fields before placing a bid:
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={4}>
          1. <b>[Round Timer]:</b> At the top left of the website, you will see
          a countdown timer ticking down. At the start of each round, this timer
          is reset to 24 hours. Every time someone places a bid, the timer adds
          1 hour. The last person to bid when the timer runs out wins the game.
        </Typography>
        <Box mb={4}>
          <img src="/images/screenshot2.png" width="100%" />
        </Box>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          2. <b>[Bid Price]:</b> Before you place a bid, you want to check the
          bid price. You can make a bid using $ETH or Cosmic Tokens ($CST).
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={4}>
          If you hold an NFT from our sister collection Random Walk NFT, you can
          get a 50% discount on your $ETH bid price. However, keep in mind that
          you can avail the 50% discount once, so be wise about using it.
        </Typography>
        <Box mb={4}>
          <img src="/images/screenshot3.png" width="100%" />
        </Box>
        <Typography mb={4}>
          3. <b>[Main Prize Reward]:</b> The Main Prize Reward displays the
          amount you will get if you win the round.
        </Typography>
        <Box mb={4}>
          <img src="/images/screenshot4.png" width="100%" />
        </Box>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          4. <b>[Last Bidder Address]:</b> The wallet address of the last person
          that made a bid.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Make sure you hold the displayed bid price in your crypto wallet (in
          $ETH or $CST) and a few extra cents to pay for gas on the Arbitrum
          blockchain.
        </Typography>
      </Box>
      <Box mt={8}>
        <Typography variant="h5" mb={4}>
          Step#3: Make A Bid!
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Once you have successfully connected your wallet, choose your method
          of bidding from $ETH or $CST.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          If you wish to avail your 50% Random Walk NFT discount, click [Random
          Walk].
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          When you click your desired currency, you will be displayed the bid
          price button.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Review this price and when you want to make a bid, click the [Bid Now]
          button.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          As soon as you click this button, you will be prompted to your wallet
          and asked to confirm the transaction.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          Make sure to review your transaction before signing it. Also check the
          gas fees, and then approve the transaction.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mb={2}>
          When you make a bid, the countdown timer will increase by 1 hour, and
          the next bid price will increase by 1%. When the timer reaches zero,
          the last player to make the bid will win the round.
